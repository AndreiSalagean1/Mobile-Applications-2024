Project Idea: Volleyball Match Organizer App 
 
Description: 
We're embarking on an exciting project to develop a user-friendly mobile application dedicated to the meticulous management of volleyball matches. This app will also allow comprehensive tracking of match-specific details. The app is designed with the intention of simplifying the process of organizing and archiving volleyball matches, all while catering to users who may not possess a technical background. 
 
Domain Details: 
Entity: Match  
Fields: 
1.	Match ID : The id of the match , ensuring a way to keep matches unique. 
2.	Date: The date on which the match was played, ensuring a chronological record. 
3.	Location: The location where the match took place. 
4.	Team 1: The name of the first competing team, a vital component for match identification. 
5.	Team 2: The name of the second competing team, equally important for accurate record-keeping. 
6.	Team Winner: The name of the team who won the match. 
 
CRUD Operations: 
 
Data Manipulation: 
-	Create: This functionality allows users to initiate a new match entry, enabling them to input essential information such as date, location, and the names of the competing teams. 
-	Read: Users can access a comprehensive list of all previously recorded matches, thereby gaining insight into match histories. 
-	Update: The application permits users to make modifications to match details, including scores and other pertinent data. 
-	Delete: In situations where a match record needs to be removed, the app provides a means for deletion. 
 
 
 
Persistence details : 
*Data in our app is kept safe in two ways:  
1.	When you create, read, update, or delete stuff, we save it on your device, so you can access it securely anytime. 
2.	We also make sure your data matches with our server, so you won't lose anything and everything stays in sync. 
 
Offline Access Scenarios: 
 
Offline functionality caters to situations where a user may not have an active internet connection: 
1.	Create Match: Users can generate new match records even when offline. The app will store the information on the user's device, and as soon as an internet connection is restored, the data will be synchronized with the central server. 
2.	Read Matches: While offline, users can access previously recorded matches, but they will not be able to retrieve new data from the server until an internet connection is reestablished. 
3.	Update Match: The application empowers users to edit match details offline. Changes made will be saved on the local device, and upon regaining connectivity, the data will be seamlessly synchronized with the server. 
4.	Delete Match: When offline, users can initiate match deletions, and the app marks the match for removal on the local device. Synchronization with the server occurs upon internet reconnection, resulting in permanent deletion from the server and local storage, ensuring consistent data management. 


App Mockup: 
Two visual representations of the application's user interface are provided below. The first captures the list  of existing volleyball matches, while the second showcases the ease of creating a new match.

It ensures data integrity and synchronization, regardless of online or offline scenarios, thus simplifying the entire process of match organization and archiving.
